CardanoSwap, a pioneering decentralized exchange on Cardano, requested our expertise to audit their Plutus-based smart contracts and validate their innovative UTXO-based DEX model.

**Challenge:**
Cardano's UTXO model presents unique security considerations compared to account-based blockchains. The challenge was ensuring the novel DEX mechanisms were secure while leveraging Cardano's unique features.

**Our Approach:**
Our Cardano specialists conducted a thorough review:
- Plutus smart contract analysis using formal verification
- UTXO spending validation logic review
- Concurrent transaction handling assessment
- Economic model analysis and validation
- Integration testing with Cardano infrastructure

**Key Findings:**
1. Logic error in UTXO handling that could lock funds
2. Potential for transaction collision in high-traffic scenarios
3. Insufficient validation in Plutus scripts
4. Economic attack vector through fee manipulation
5. Datum validation vulnerability

**Technical Deep Dive:**
The most critical issue involved improper UTXO consumption logic that could result in permanent fund locks. Our team identified this through extensive testing of edge cases in concurrent transaction scenarios.

**Results:**
All issues were resolved, and the DEX launched successfully. The platform has processed over $5M in trading volume with zero security incidents.

**Innovation:**
This audit helped establish best practices for UTXO-based DEX development, contributing to the broader Cardano ecosystem security standards.

**Client Testimonial:**
"Mirage Audits' deep understanding of Cardano's UTXO model was crucial for our DEX. Their insights helped us build a more robust and efficient platform." - Lead Developer, CardanoSwap
