ArtChain developed a next-generation NFT marketplace focusing on digital art with innovative royalty mechanisms, auction systems, and creator tools. They needed comprehensive security validation before mainnet launch.

**Challenge:**
NFT marketplaces handle valuable digital assets and complex transaction flows. Security concerns included royalty manipulation, auction mechanisms, and protecting creator rights.

**Our Approach:**
- NFT contract and marketplace smart contract audit
- Auction mechanism security validation
- Royalty distribution system review
- Creator protection mechanism assessment
- Integration testing with external NFT collections

**Key Findings:**
1. Royalty bypass vulnerability in secondary sales
2. Auction manipulation through bid timing attacks
3. Metadata manipulation potential
4. Insufficient creator verification
5. Fee calculation errors in complex transactions

**Creator Protection Innovation:**
We helped implement an immutable royalty system and enhanced creator verification mechanisms that became industry standards.

**Results:**
ArtChain launched successfully and has facilitated over $8M in NFT sales with robust creator protection. The platform maintains a 99.9% uptime record.

**Community Impact:**
This audit helped establish best practices for NFT marketplace security, with our recommendations being adopted across the NFT ecosystem.
