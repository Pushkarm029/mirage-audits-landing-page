SolanaFi approached us to conduct a comprehensive security audit of their innovative DeFi protocol built on Solana. The protocol featured automated liquidity provisioning, yield farming mechanisms, and complex token swap functionalities.

**Challenge:**
The protocol's architecture included multiple interacting smart contracts with sophisticated economic mechanisms. The main concerns were around MEV protection, liquidity pool security, and flash loan attack vectors.

**Our Approach:**
Our team conducted a thorough 2-week audit process:
- Static code analysis of all Rust-based smart contracts
- Dynamic testing with custom fuzzing tools
- Economic model validation and stress testing
- Integration testing across all contract interactions

**Key Findings:**
1. Critical vulnerability in liquidity pool calculation that could allow drainage of funds
2. Reentrancy attack vector in the yield farming contract
3. Integer overflow possibility in token swap mechanisms
4. MEV vulnerability in transaction ordering
5. Governance token manipulation potential

**Results:**
All critical and high-severity issues were resolved before mainnet deployment. The protocol successfully launched and has maintained zero security incidents post-audit. Total value secured: $50M+.

**Client Testimonial:**
"Mirage Audits' expertise in Solana's unique architecture was invaluable. Their detailed analysis and practical recommendations helped us build a robust, secure protocol." - CTO, SolanaFi
